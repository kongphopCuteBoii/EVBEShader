So, there are a few things you need to know before editing the configurator.
 [!] Use monospaced font and turn off Word warp to make the instructions easier to read.
  [1.] Toggle
    It's a type of editing that used to turn on and off features in the shader.
    What to do? It's really easy.
    
    For example here :
        #define amogus_spinning
      to enable amogus_spinning
    and :
        //#define amogus_spinning
      to disable amogus_spinning
      
    Yeah, it's that simple.
    Basically, put // in front of #define to disable that feature; remove it to enable.
    
  [2.] Value
    It's a type of editing that uses value for editing.
    Basically, just edit the value as you would like to.
     [!] Always use decimal values for editing. Or else, the game will occur an error.

These are simple instructions you need to know; now you can properly edit the configurator.
Hope this useful. Please enjoy using the shader!
